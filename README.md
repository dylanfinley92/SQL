School Project SQL Code

This repository contains the SQL code that I used for a school project to pass the class. The project consisted of two parts: demonstrating competency in normalization and ER diagrams, and writing tables and queries.

Part 1: Normalization and ER Diagrams

In the first part of the project, I demonstrated my competency in normalization and ER diagrams. I created an ER diagram to model the data for a fictional company that sells products online. I then used the principles of normalization to transform the ER diagram into a set of normalized tables.
The ER diagram and the normalized tables can be found in the PartA of the pdf.

Part 2: Tables and Queries

In the second part of the project, I wrote the SQL code to create the tables and queries for the database that I designed in Part 1. The code includes the table definitions, constraints, and sample data. I also wrote a set of queries to retrieve and manipulate the data in the database.
The SQL code can be found in the PartB folder of this repository. The EHN1Tasks1and2.pdf file contains the SQL code to create the tables, and it contains the SQL code for the queries.

Acknowledgments

I would like to thank my professor for providing me with the opportunity to learn and demonstrate my skills in SQL and database design.
